How to Adopt Contributor Covenant
Your code of conduct should be easy to locate, whether as page on your community’s website or a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the root directory of your project’s repository.

You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the document so that people know how to report violations.

If you are using a README file in your source code repository, you can display a badge like this one Contributor Covenant Badge.

For markdown files, use this code:

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)
For reStructuredText files, place |Contributor Covenant| where you would like the badge and add this to the bottom of the file:

.. |Contributor Covenant| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg :target: code_of_conduct.md
